iterate R till currK = k - 1 is exhausted;

Use Multiple pointers
L , R for the sub linklist to be reversed
LastLinkListStart.Next to point to Start of current reversed sub List which is R
LastLinkListStart becomes left of current reversed sub List as its the last element
L = R =  nextListStart
refresh  currK = k - 1 ; repeat


if (previousListEnd != null)
{
                previousListEnd.next = left;
}
