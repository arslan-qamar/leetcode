Easy peasy with a Hashset but its not that simple as it is O(n) time and O(n) space

It is Floyd's algorithm where you have two pointers slow and fast and when they collide we run another slow2 with slow ptr
when slow2 and slow collide that is the start of the cycle and we return the output. This takes O(1) times
