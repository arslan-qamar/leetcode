This is pretty similar to a common Djikstra algorithm , 
the only trick is to add the Max(curr.cost, grid[r][c]) to the minHeap for the 4 grid neighbours which can 
be added easily using the directions[][] array in a foreach with if base case :  

int[][] directions = new int[][] {

            new int[]{1, 0 },
            new int[] {-1, 0 },
            new int[] {0, 1 },
            new int[] {0, -1 }

            };
