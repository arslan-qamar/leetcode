The trick is to create the adjList and then sort the stops for each From : Stops(sorted)

Now we do a modified Dfs where remove the next stop from the adjList and do Dfs and also do Dfs with leftover ones if any.

The iteranary is reversed and the count should be  iternary.Count == tickets.Count + 1

CRAM IT :/
