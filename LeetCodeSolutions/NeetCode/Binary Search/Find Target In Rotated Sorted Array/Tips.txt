Use Binary Search to find the target.
Search in Left if target is less than mid and lies between left and mid OR 
left is greater than mid which means the switch lies between left and mid and since target is less than mid its definitely in left section: 

	  if (target < nums[m] && (nums[l] < target || nums[l] > nums[m]))
         {
             r = m - 1;
         }
