Find the left partition on both arrays such that the size of both is roughly same as half of their total elements and they satisfy this condition
if (maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1)
otherwise decrease r if (maxLeft1 > minRight2)
else increase l by 1

throw exception at the end , can happen when the array are not sorted propertly.


cram it mate its good but tought to get into OOBE , Practice more.
