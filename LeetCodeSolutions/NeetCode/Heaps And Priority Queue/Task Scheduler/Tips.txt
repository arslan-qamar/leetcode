We have to consume the highest priority tasks first, as that helps with better useage of time and less pauses
so pop N highest frequency items and decrement their count by 1
and push them back to maxheap

if maxheap count is still > 0 , then increase the totalCycleCount by n+1
else increase the totalCycleCount by size of popped items
