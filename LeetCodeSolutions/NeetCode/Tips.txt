Use HashSet to keep track of if a value was already seen in a list.
Use int[] to keep track of chars count by storing the COUNT for 'a' on 0 index and 'b' on 1 index. use [(int)c - (int)'a']
If you know the expected value of variable you are finding. Consider using Dictionary to keep track if we have seen the expected value before.
If you want the result set to be grouped, find a way to calculate common key value (it can be common freq count, hashcode etc) and store the items on same key in a list.
Use Prefix and Postfix array for the number you want to exclude from a total result in an array for any math operation (Product except self)
