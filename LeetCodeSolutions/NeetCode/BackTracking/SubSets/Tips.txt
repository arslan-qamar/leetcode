Backtracking technique is to do DFS on the list with current value added to the accumulator 
and another DFS run without the value

General Structure is : 

DFS_Method(index)
	Base case (usually index >= nums.Count)
		Add the subset copy to the main result set

	Add current index value to subset accumulator
	DFS_Method(index + 1)
	Remove last value from subset accumulator
	DFS_Method(index + 1)
