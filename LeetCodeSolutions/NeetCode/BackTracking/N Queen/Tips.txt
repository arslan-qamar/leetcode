Use BackTracking, do Dfs row wise

*** The trick is to keep track of column and diagonals (positive slope (r+c) and negative slope (r-c))  and if the current row and col exists in the hashsets skip over

Base Case : 
	Add copy of board to result when row == n

update board[row][col] to Q
update hashsets

dfs(row + 1)

undo board[row][col] to .
undo hashsets
