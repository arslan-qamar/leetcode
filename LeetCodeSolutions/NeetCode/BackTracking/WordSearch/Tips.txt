Iterate the matrix by r,c clear visited , if the spot is start of word[0] , do dfs with index
do a dfs right left up down with 2 base cases return when
	- row,col is not going out of bound
	- the value of spot is not equal to word[index]
	- the spot is already visited 

	- the index == word.Length -> return true

add r,c to visited

res = do dfs

remove r,c from visited

return dfs res
