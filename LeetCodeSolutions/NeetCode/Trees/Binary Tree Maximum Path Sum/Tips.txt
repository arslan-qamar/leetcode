The trick is to use DFS, and pass the MaxPath variable as ref to inner function to keep max updated on recursion.

leftMax , rightMax should stay be Max(0, Dfs(node.direction, ref maxPath)) -> because there is no point adding negative 

return 0 when node is null

maxPath = Max(maxPath , leftMax + rightMax + node.Val);

return node.val + Max(left, right)
