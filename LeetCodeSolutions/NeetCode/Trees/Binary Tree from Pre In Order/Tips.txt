Preorder first element is the root so use it as root

Get the index of first element in inorder array as it tells the elements before it are lefttree elements on inorder array
Preorder for left tree is skip(1) and take (index) on the preorder array (Skip one as we used first node for root)

the elements after index+1 are righttree elements on in order array
Preorder for right tree are skip(index+1) on the preorder array (Skip one as we used first node for root)
