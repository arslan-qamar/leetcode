Keep character count of target string
start with window size of 0 and track character count and matched counts, keep increasing R till matched counts == target counts
update the minimumknownWindow size and keep moving L to reduce window size until  matched counts != target counts also updating the character counts for current window
increment r


return the substring if there is value for l,r. Otherwise return empty.
