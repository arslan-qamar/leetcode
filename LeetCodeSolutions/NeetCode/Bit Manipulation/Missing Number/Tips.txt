Sum the total of numbers by gauss formulae : n(n+1) / 2
Subtract each value in nums from Total to get the missing number



XOR Approach :

Key idea:
In the array, one number from 1 to n is missing.
xor1 contains the XOR of all numbers from 1 to n.
xor2 contains the XOR of the elements in the array (which excludes the missing number).
XORing xor1 with xor2 cancels out all the numbers that are present in both (since x⊕x=0) and leaves only the missing number.

Example:For n=5

XOR of all numbers from 1 to 5:

xor1=1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5=3

XOR of all elements in the array[1,2,4,5]:

xor2=1⊕2⊕4⊕5=0

The missing number:3⊕0=3

So, the missing number is 3.
