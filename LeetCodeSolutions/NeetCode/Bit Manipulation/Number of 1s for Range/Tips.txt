Number of 1s are one more than the count in exponential backoffset 
e.g : 

Dec           Binary            Offset
0	          0                 
1	          1                 1
2	          10				2
3	          11				2
4	          100				4
5	          101				4
6	          110				4
7	          111				4
8	          1000				8


4 has 0100 1 more 1 compared to 0 0000 (offset 4)
8 also has 1000 1 more 1 compared to 0 0000 (offset 8) only the position of 1 changed compared to 4
