Create a double directed adj list for the edges

do a dfs from 0 as i and it should return true 

return dfs && visited == num

base case :
	if already visited return false

add to visited 

dfs on neigbours
	Remove i from the neighbour list to avoid false cycle detection. (The two or more hop cycle would stay)
	if !Dfs
		return false

return true
