Trick is to use Dictionary<Node, Node> oldToNew and store the newly created nodes in it in recursive function. 

Rest is simple traversal with basecase

node == null
	return null

oldToNew contains node
	return oldToNew[node] 


NewNode = new Node(oldNode.val)
oldToNew[node]  = NewNode

Traverse Neighbours in a loop
	NewNode.NeighBours.Add(node.Neighbour[i])
