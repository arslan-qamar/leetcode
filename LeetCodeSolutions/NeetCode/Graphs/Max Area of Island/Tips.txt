This is different to the num of islands in the sense that we need to count the area of each island 
where the trick is to return the area count from dfs recursive call and do (also do not call dfs on already visited spot)

base cases (boundary , not already visited, not == 1)

add to visited 

return 1 + up + down + right + left

no need to clear visited ones.
