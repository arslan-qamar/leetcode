The trick is similar to Island And Treasure to do BFS from rotting fruits to fresh fruits and
mark the neighbour fruit as rotten and added to the BFS queue and process in next layer.


The tricky bit is to return -1 if not all the fruits get rotten which can be tracked in the first traversal
to count the initial fresh fruits and add the initial rotten fruits to bfs queue loop.


At the end if fruitsCount is not 0 then return -1 else return result (0 default)
