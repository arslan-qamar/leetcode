This is a tricky one but not so tricky

The trick is to create a Adjacency list of pattern, <List of Matching Words>

If endWord is not in the List of words straight up return 0

So a word beginWord would create *eginword = <w1,w3,wx> and b*ginword and so on...

Now we start BFS because BFS is layer by layer, where each layer is the sequence step in this problem case towards the goal

In Bfs layer process if the endWord is found we return the current step/result(starts at 1)

If not then for each word, append all the words for its possible patterns to be processed in next layer of BFS , increment result++

If BFS ends and nothing found return 0 (hot -> dog , with list of words just [dog] , not possible to get dog from hot with just one word)
