This is solveable by Union Find , since there is only one edge that causes the cycle so that cycle union would result in no union
As a result when Union find does no union that edge is the problem as both its parents are same 
and adding another edge would cause a loop as a complete Graph has V vertices and V-1 edges, 
adding one more edge always creates a cycle in a compelte graph.
