The trick here is to use a Monotinic decreasing Queue. 
Iterate the array from l=0 and increasing r. Push the element index in monotonic queue (popping the element indexes while their num[index] value is less than nums[r] before push)
if(r +1 >= windowsize/k) , push the first element in Queue to the output array as its the biggest in the window , increment l
if(l > the first index value in the queue) , pop first value
r++
